Your

00:00:14,435 --> 00:00:15,034
Your boy

3
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:15,324
Your boy boy

4
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:15,624
Your boy boy boy

00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:15,764
Your boy boy boy boy

00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:16,507
Your boy boy boy boy boyfriend

7
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:28,375
Have you ever had the feeling you're drawn to someone?

8
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:28,891
Have you ever had the feeling you're drawn to someone?
Yeah

9
00:00:29,135 --> 00:00:32,858
And it isn't anything they could've said or done

10
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:36,039
And everyday I see you on your own.

11
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:38,495
And I can't believe that you're all alone.

12
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:42,054
But I overheard your girls and this what they said

13
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:42,664
But I overheard your girls and this what they said
<i>Looking for a</i>

14
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:43,498
But I overheard your girls and this what they said
<i>Looking for a, looking for a</i>

15
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:52,954
Can't you see? All I really wanna be.

16
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:55,525
Is your Boyfriend™. Can't fight that

17
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,955
Knock me down, you know, I'm coming right back

18
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:00,283
I don't care at all what you done before

19
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:02,754
All I really want is to be your.

20
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:06,005
Let me take a little moment to find the right words

21
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:07,298
Let me take a little moment to find the right words
<i>To find the right</i>

22
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:10,851
So when I kick it to you it ain't something that you've heard

23
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:12,015
So when I kick it to you it ain't something that you've heard
<i>Something that you've</i>

24
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:14,289
I don't know what kind of guy that you prefer

25
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:16,799
But I know I gotta put myself for worse

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,672
See I think I got the kind of love that you deserve and I heard that

27
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:31,394
Can't you see? All I really wanna be.

28
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:33,895
Is your Boyfriend™. Can't fight that

29
00:01:33,905 --> 00:01:36,309
Knock me down, you know, I'm coming right back

30
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,672
I don't care at all what you done before

31
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:42,746
All I really want is to be your.
