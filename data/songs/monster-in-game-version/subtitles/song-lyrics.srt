1
00:00:03,175 --> 00:00:05,954
Think of these thoughts as limitless light

2
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:07,914
Exposing, closing 

3
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:09,445
Circuitry of fright

4
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:11,164
Think of each moment

5
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:12,455
Holding this breath

6
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:15,265
As death minute in decimal

7
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:18,764
Resident Boyfriend, how do you plead

8
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:22,304
We'll need your testimony on the stand 

9
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:25,134
Solemnly swear to tell the whole truth

10
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:28,820
So help you, son, now raise your right hand

11
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:44,931
Condemn him to the infirmary


12
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:50,823
All mine towers crumble down

13
00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:54,374
The flowers gasping under rubble

14
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:57,155
Shrieking in the hall of lull

15
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:01,009
Thy genius sates a thirst for trouble

16
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:09,985
Here in my kingdom, I am your lord

17
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,538
I order you to cower and pray

18
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:19,834
Nuns commence incanting as the

19
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:22,734
Lightning strikes mine temples thus

20
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:26,414
Electrifying mine chambers wholly

21
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:29,266
Scorching out thine sovereignty

22
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:50,504
See how the serfs work the ground

23
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:52,384
See how the serfs work the ground
(See how they fall)

24
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:54,821
And they give it all they've got
(See how they fall)

25
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:55,694
And they give it all they've got

26
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:57,752
And they give it all they've got
(Fall)

27
00:01:58,155 --> 00:01:58,574
And you give it all you've got till you're down

28
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:02,894
And you give it all you've got till you're down
(Fall)

29
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:03,254
Ha

30
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:03,614
Ha ha

31
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:04,024
Ha ha ha

32
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:04,264
Ha ha ha ha

33
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:09,555
See how the brain plays around

34
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:13,814
And you fall inside a hole you couldn't see

35
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:18,753
And you fall inside a hole inside a

36
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:26,806
Understand what's going on inside my mind

37
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:46,014
Never they ponder whether electric

38
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:49,398
Calming if you look at it right
