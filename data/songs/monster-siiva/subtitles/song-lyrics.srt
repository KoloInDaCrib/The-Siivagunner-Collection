1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,556
Ooh- hooh-

2
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:12,248
La la la la~

3
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:28,783
You still see my shadow in your room.

4
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:31,455
Can't run back and leave us behind you.

5
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:34,059
It's to the point where I'm going to kill you-

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,766
-and I'm gonna eat you so I must remove your bones.

7
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:39,321
Easier said than done,

8
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:40,724
I thought you were the one,

9
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,006
Draining all of your heart-

10
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:43,282
-dissecting your head.

11
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:44,732
I found another one-

12
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:46,201
-but you are the better one-

13
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:48,242
-I won't let you escape me.

14
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:14,227
I'll make sure that you will-

15
00:01:14,228 --> 00:01:17,107
-end up inside your grave.

16
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:21,018
You know that I want your head.

17
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:37,054
You fear these lucid dreams,

18
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,894
Where you can't move a thing.

19
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:43,703
Blood dripping off of your bed.

20
00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:58,675
I'll do it over again

21
00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:00,056
I just want you to end

22
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:01,556
Watch ashes blow in the wind,

23
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:03,124
You should've listened to your friends

24
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,644
Did this shit in the past,

25
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:06,032
Do not want you to last,

26
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,411
You were made out of fleshy steak.

27
00:02:08,537 --> 00:02:11,420
You were tangled up in your bed for days.

28
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:14,145
Who knew demon girls had the tastiest fate.

29
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,062
Took away your heart now your life is at stake.

30
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:19,561
Now I ate your heart and made you

31
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:20,002
Now I ate your heart and made you break.

32
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:23,132
I'll make your heart break.

33
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,285
I'll make your heart ache.

34
00:02:26,372 --> 00:02:29,438
I'll make your heart break.

35
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:32,713
I'll make your heart ache.

36
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:35,668
I'll make your heart break.

37
00:02:35,798 --> 00:02:38,662
I'll make your heart ache.

38
00:02:38,788 --> 00:02:43,184
I'll make your heart break again.

39
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:47,625
You still see my shadow in your room.

40
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:50,275
Can't run back and leave us behind you.

41
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,704
It's to the point where I'm going to kill you-

42
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:56,155
-and I'm gonna eat you so I must remove your bones.

43
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:57,494
Easier said than done,

44
00:02:57,495 --> 00:02:58,854
I thought you were the one,

45
00:02:58,855 --> 00:03:00,144
Draining all of your heart-

46
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:01,315
-dissecting your head.

47
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:02,764
I found another one-

48
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,134
-but you are the better one-

49
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:05,837
-I won't let you escape me.

50
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:29,745
Did this shit in the past,

51
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:31,485
Do not want you to last,

52
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:34,175
You were made out of fleshy steak.

53
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:37,705
You were tangled up in your bed for days.

54
00:03:37,844 --> 00:03:41,103
Who knew demon girls had the tastiest fate.
