1
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:17,444
I was tryin' to find a way to kill time

2
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:23,234
I didn't even get to tell you goodbye

3
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:29,064
I was tryin' to find a way to kill time

4
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:35,087
Now you're gone and I can't ever say goodbye

5
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,184
This feeling's goin' to my head,

6
00:00:38,185 --> 00:00:41,054
I'm thinkin' things I shouldn't say

7
00:00:41,055 --> 00:00:44,004
You circled me inside my room,

8
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:45,144
I couldn't

9
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:45,444
I couldn't go

10
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:45,794
I couldn't go, go

11
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,164
I couldn't go, go, go

12
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:46,584
I couldn't go, go, go, go

13
00:00:46,585 --> 00:00:48,004
Oh my god, what the fuck?

14
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:49,454
Take my hand, crush it up

15
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:50,874
Spill the blood on the floor,

16
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,324
I ain't scared, think there's more

17
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:53,744
What the fuck? Make it stop,

18
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:55,164
Took too long, here right now

19
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:56,744
On the floor, in the car,

20
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:58,244
Smokin' cigs in the bar

21
00:00:58,245 --> 00:00:59,674
I don't want you to think

22
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:01,174
I got bad intentions

23
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:02,603
Never wanted you inside

24
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,794
You made it your mission, yeah (<i>Yeah</i>)

25
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:06,754
Didn't wanna hurt no one

26
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:08,774
But you just went and made it fun, fun, fun, fun

27
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:09,874
But you just went and made it fun, fun, fun, fun
Hear you're lookin' for a

28
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,374
Way to fight the Corpus bride

29
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,574
She's workin' in my mind

30
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,654
And you're lookin' for a

31
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:18,235
Way to crush, it's not enough

32
00:01:18,238 --> 00:01:20,674
You fucked up your last try, you cannot try (Last try)

33
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:23,694
We were in the studio, I was just playin'

34
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:26,604
You were all work and I was all play and

35
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:29,524
You were talkin' business, aimin' with your weapon

36
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:33,150
I was on your hit list, I felt the compression
